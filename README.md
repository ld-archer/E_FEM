# English Future Elderly Model

This is the repository for the English version of the Future Elderly Model (FEM), originally developed at the Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Microsimulation, at the University of Southern California. This project is the result of a collaboration between Bryan Tysinger (USC), Dr. Nik Lomax and Professor Stephane Hess (both University of Leeds, UK). The original model and some of it's applications is described [here](https://healthpolicy.usc.edu/future-elderly-model/). 

The English FEM is a dynamic microsimulation model of health trajectories amongst the elderly population.
