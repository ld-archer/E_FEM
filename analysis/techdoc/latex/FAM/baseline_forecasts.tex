\section{Baseline Forecasts}
In this section we present baseline forecasts of the Future Americans Model.  The figures show data from the PSID for the 25+ population from 1999 through 2009 and 
forecasts from the FAM for the 25+ population beginning in 2009.

\subsection{Disease Prevalence}
Figure \ref{fig:chronic_diseases_male} depicts the six chronic conditions we project for men.  And Figure \ref{fig:chronic_diseases_female} depicts the historic 
and forecasted values for women.
