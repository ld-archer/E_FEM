\subsection{External Corroboration}
Finally, we compare FEM population forecasts to Census forecasts of the US population..  Here, we focus on the full HRS population (51 and older) and those 65 and 
older.  For this exercise, we begin the simulation in 2010 and simulate the full population through 2050.  Population projections are compared to the 2012 Census 
projections for years 2012 through 2050.  FEM population forecasts are always within two percent of Census forecasts.
