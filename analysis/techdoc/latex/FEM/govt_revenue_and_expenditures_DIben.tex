\subsection{Disability Insurance benefits}
Workers with enough quarters of coverage and under the normal retirement age are eligible for their PIA (no reduction factor) if they are 
judged disabled (which we take as the predicted outcome of DI receipt) and earnings are under a cap called the Substantial Gainful Activity 
(SGA) limit. This limit was \$9720 in 2004. We ignore the 9 month trial period over a 5 year window in which the SGA is ignored.
