\section{Data sources for trends and baseline scenario}
Two types of trends need to be projected in the model. First, we need to project trends in the 
incoming cohorts (the future new age 51/52 individuals). This includes trends in health and economic 
outcomes. Second, we need to project excess aggregate growth in real income and excess growth in 
health spending.
