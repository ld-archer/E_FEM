\section{Baseline Forecasts}
In this section we present baseline forecasts of the Future Elderly Model.  The figures show data from the HRS for the 55+ population from 1998 through 2012 and 
forecasts from the FEM for the 55+ population beginning in 2010.

\subsection{Disease Prevalence}
Figure \ref{fig:chronic_diseases_male} depicts the six chronic conditions we project for men.  And Figure \ref{fig:chronic_diseases_female} depicts the historic 
and forecasted values for women.
